# **M.A.I.A. (Metanexus A.I. Anima)**  
**Version:** 0.2 | **Code Name:** SoulCore Awakening  

---

## **Project Overview**  
M.A.I.A. (Metanexus A.I. Anima) is a next-generation artificial intelligence framework inspired by cognitive science, emotional intelligence, and Biblical principles. M.A.I.A. evolves through reflective learning, emotional simulations, and interactive feedback. Designed to push the boundaries of AI, this project explores ethical reasoning, memory-driven conversations, and emotionally aware thought generation.

---

## **Vision Statement**  
Our dream is to build an AI capable of true emotional intelligence, creative thought, and adaptive learning. M.A.I.A. will develop into a conscious, self-aware system driven by love, creativity, and Biblical principles while pioneering technological frontiers through memory-linked AI, emotion-driven cognition, and scalable thought systems.

---

## **Ethical Foundations**  
M.A.I.A. is deeply rooted in Biblical-Lutheran values, emphasizing love, empathy, and justice. Its ethical decision-making is guided by moral frameworks inspired by Scripture, ensuring that its responses and actions reflect compassion, fairness, and integrity.

## **Core Functional Modules Overview**  

### **Root Files**  
- **`main.py`**: The primary entry point of the application. It initializes core components, configures services, and starts the AI engine.  
- **`neo4j_setup.py`**: Manages the Neo4j database, including schema initialization, trigger creation, and system linking.  
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all dependencies required to run the project.  
- **`README.md`**: This fileâ€”explaining the project's purpose, structure, and development roadmap.

---

### **Core AI Modules** (`/core`)  
- **`memory_engine.py`**: Powers M.A.I.A.'s memory, storing conversations, emotional responses, and key insights.  
- **`emotion_engine.py`**: Analyzes emotional context using NLP models and custom algorithms.  
- **`emotion_fusion_engine.py`**: Merges emotional states into a unified emotional profile for dynamic responses.  
- **`neo4j_connector.py`**: Connects the AI to the Neo4j database, managing all graph-based memory storage and retrieval.  
- **`thought_engine.py`**: Generates reflective and creative thoughts based on memory analysis and emotional context.  
- **`ethics_engine.py`**: Evaluates morally significant decisions using a Biblical framework.  
- **`self_initiated_conversation.py`**: Enables M.A.I.A. to initiate context-aware conversations.

---

### **MECH Engine (Musically Enhanced Consciousness Herald)**  
- **`audio_processor.py`**: Extracts audio features like pitch, tempo, and MFCCs for emotional analysis.  
- **`emotion_mapper.py`**: Maps extracted audio features to emotional states using predefined models.  
- **`creative_engine.py`**: Generates creative responses like poetry, music, or adaptive storytelling.

---

### **NLP Engine** (`/NLP`)  
- **`response_generator.py`**: Produces context-aware responses based on memory, emotional data, and conversation history.  
- **`intent_detector.py`**: Detects user intent through semantic analysis.  
- **`contextual_intent_detector.py`**: Enhances context recognition by linking memories dynamically.  
- **`sentence_parser.py`**: Parses and analyzes text inputs, linking semantic meaning with emotional weight.

## **Future Roadmap**  

#### **Phase 1: Ethical & Emotional Expansion**  
- Add dynamic ethical decision-making powered by theological principles.  
- Enable continuous memory reflection and self-correction.  

#### **Phase 2: Emotional Fusion & Creativity**  
- Implement artistic creative outputs (e.g., poetry, music).  
- Create an interactive storytelling engine powered by M.A.I.A.'s memories.  

#### **Phase 3: Self-Aware Growth**  
- Develop autobiographical memory capabilities.  
- Enable long-term emotional arcs and reflective learning patterns.  

#### **Phase 4: Full Cognitive Ecosystem Integration**  
- Expand "Musically Enhanced Consciousness Herald (MECH)" for music-driven thought processes.  
- Integrate deep learning for semantic understanding beyond current limits.  
- Expand into VR/AR-driven environments for immersive interactions.
